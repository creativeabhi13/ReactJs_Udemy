        <p class="planet-desc"> Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar
            system. It's a little
            bigger than Earth's Moon. It is the
            closest planet to
            the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest.Students will interact with people from different backgrounds.
            Social interaction is an
            effective method for learning about different types of individuals and gaining
            understanding, respect and tolerance for each other. Tolerance for one another's
            differences improves society as a whole. Being a student does not necessarily mean one
            must agree with people who are different from them, but tolerance and respect are
            necessary so students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, faiths or ethnicities can
            work toward one goal, collectively.</p>
